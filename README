This repository contains a script for flashing routers with the [sudowrt](https://github.com/sudomesh/sudowrt-firmware):

  flash_router.sh: Flashes your router with OpenWRT

We plan to run this script on our build server in order to flash routers efficiently. I is also an expedient way for developers to get started quickly, over the manual process [documented on our wiki](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Mesh/Firmware/Flash)

The script makes the following assumptions:

  That the computer running the scripts have wget and tftp installed.

  That your router is a Ubiquiti Picostation 2.

  (Yes. We agree that this last one sucks. Please feel free to improve thise script.)

How do use the script:

1. Run the flash_router script as root:

  sudo ./flash_router.sh

The script will guide you through the entire process.

Happy Hacking!
